The main platform is a software prototype aims to demostrate the 
capaiblity and availablity of the cognitive lingustic behavior modelling
(CLBM) in signal processing application. 
The system implement rule based abstraction and inference engine through 
javascript. Plus Java Applet is used to interface the functionlity. 
The system also have a Q/A unit to guarantee the quality.

Requirements:
The system is design for online usage. Any OS have latest Internet Browser
and Java Virtual Machine is capable to running the software. However, if 
you need explore the internal system, the following steps are required to deploy 
the system on to your local station. 
 
Usage:
  1. Clone this repo
     git clone git@github.com/xingzhong/ssptool.git
  2. For kernel functionlity, the routines are written in clbm.js
  3. For interface, the functionlity is written through a Java Applet project, 
     Eclipse is required to generated vaild jar file.
  4. Point to index.html through browser. The webpage will automatically load jar 
     package generated from step 3. 
  5. Examples folder contains the test for code for abstraction and inference.
  6. test_framework/test.html is the Q/A compoenent for this project.
